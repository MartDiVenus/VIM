        v1.0.1: Nov 06, 2021    * Mistake #1. 
autoload/netrw.vim and syntax/netrw.vim \

	v1.0.2: Nov 10, 2021	* Mistake #2.
/usr/share/vim/vim82/colors/mart.vim \
wrong colour name,  << mart >>  not  << martLux >>, an  accidental mistake of
course.

~/.vim/plugins/Valentine/netrw/commands/inverseMarkedSource.sh \
~/.vim/plugins/Valentine/netrw/commands/inverseMarkedDest.sh \
cutted in \
~/.vim/vimfiles/Valentine/netrw/commands/ \
~/.vim/vimfiles/Valentine/netrw/commands/ \
and, in them, I've added << sort >>  before  << comm >>, they need it in some \
cases.

		v1.1.4: Nov 11, 2021	* Mistake #4
<< QuickHelp2: (actions5) ot:open term here >> not << ... term in !fd >> \
